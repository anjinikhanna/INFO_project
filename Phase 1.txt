PHASE 1 Names: Anjini Khanna (ak2428), Aryan Khanna  (ak2253)Link to Github repository: https://github.com/anjinikhanna/INFO_project.gitIdeas for datasets:1.	Non-voters in USA dataset (found on Github using the FiveThirtyEight's datasets: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters) – comprises voters’ behaviour information using a sample of 5,836 respondents. The most important variable in the dataset – that is, “voter_category” is a categorical variable of the individual’s voting behaviour. We plan on using this sample to analyse the independent effect of an individual’s education level, age, gender, and income category on voting decision using a regression model. 2.	Titanic Dataset (found on Github: https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv)-comprises the survival information of 1309 passengers that boarded the famous Titanic ship that hit the iceberg and sunk. The most important variable in the dataset — that is, “Survived” is a dummy variable for whether or not the given passenger survived. Our goal is to use this variable as the dependent variable and perform regression analysis to figure out how the other variables — age , gender, passenger class [ first class, second class, or third class] , and cabin floor impacted the probability of an individual surviving.3.	Police Killings in America in 2015 dataset (found on Github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings) – comprises the demographic information of police killings of 468 Americans in year 2015. The most important variable in the dataset – that is, ‘race/ethnicity’ is a categorical variable of the deceased individual’s race. We aim to use this sample to analyze the independent effect of race on police killings. Questions for reviewers:*	How big must the dataset be to qualify for this project?*	Would a regression analysis be alright for impact evaluation?
